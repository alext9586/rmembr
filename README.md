# Rmembr

This is a breadcrumbing app used to remember mental navigation. I created this app to keep track of how I got somewhere when looking at legacy code.

The app is client-side only and runs in a web browser.

Run `npm install` to install packages.

Run `npm start` from root folder to start a hot-reload dev environment.
